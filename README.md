# Greetings to Ekir!
This mod is my own personal project within the video game Stellaris.
It is a dev branch where all my project are merged together, currently condensing:
## Ekir Specie Pack (spinoff Protogens)
- Associated with the Protogen Portrait mod this allows you to have the name in the Ekirian Commonwdealth!
## Summit of Arcologies
- An expansion of arcologies, also known as ecumenopolis, where every civilisations will find themself new districts and features to turn their arcologies to the next level.
## Ekirian Stellar Navy
- The Ekirian Stellar Navy made it's way to Stellaris and civilisations all across the galaxy have snagged a copy of the blueprints to use for their own, you too can now enjoy Ekirian designs and enjoy more diversified ship loadouts and roles!
